# Data 22700 Data Visualization and Communication
Datasets and visualizations were cleaned and produced using Pandas, NumPy, Altair, MatPlotLib, and NetworkX and PyVis (networks) libraries in Python and were created for DATA 22700: Data Visualization and Communication, a data science elective at UChicago. Below are a sample of some highlighted visualizations and corresponding analysis. 

### Twitter Interactions Between the Most-Followed U.S. Congresspeople
Data Source: Pablo Barbera (GitHub: pablobarbera), “Data Science Workshop - Congress Twitter Network,” https://github.com/pablobarbera/data-science-workshop/tree/master/sna/data. Note: though the source does not specify when the data was pulled from Twitter, the files were uploaded to GitHub in 2015, which is assumed to be the year of data collection.*

*Among the thirty most-followed Congresspeople on Twitter in 2015, fifteen belonged to the Republican party, fourteen to the Democratic party, and one to the Independent party, representing a balanced composition across party lines. Senator John McCain had the largest following at nearly 2m followers and Sen. Bernie Sanders trailed at 1.2m, followed successively by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Ted Cruz, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and Senator Elizabeth Warren. For both Democrats and Republicans, most Congresspeople primarily interacted with members of their own party on Twitter, a trend especially prominent for party leaders Pelosi and Ryan, who appear at opposite sides of the network. Nevertheless, there exists a large amount of cross-party digital interaction senators and representatives at the lower end of the top 30, including Sen. Tim Scott, Sen. Chuck Schumer, and Sen. Dick Durbin. Additionally, a subset of politicians who hold relatively radical positions within their party, including Senators Warren and Sanders, appear to display high cross-party Twitter engagement, though further research is necessary to substantiate this finding.*

### Mapping Human Rights Across the World
Data Sources: Schnakenberg and Fariss (2014); Fariss (2019). Note: Scores were produced from an econometric model that combines metrics from nine other sources.

As illuminated in the figure above, most countries had Human Rights Scores (HRS) close to or below zero in 2017, with the majority of low-protection countries in Africa, and the highest concentration of high-protection countries in Western Europe and Scandinavia. While South Sudan, Syria, and Myanmar, among others, expectedly displayed low levels of protection for citizen’s physical integrity, North Korea was the fifth worst country for HR protection, despite its notorious reputation. Meanwhile, the U.S. had a HRS of 0.2, far lower than expected given the country’s reputation for peace-keeping and democracy.

 Notably, the second figure reveals that human rights protections in the U.S. declined over the period, even as most countries in the world progressed, indicated by positive changes in their HRS. Nearly every country in South America improved, as did most in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Altogether, recent data on the state of global human rights reveal low levels of protection across most of the world, with some countries displaying surprising results relative to their reputations for oppression or humanitarian intervention. However, whether due to the march of progress, regime change, or random factors, the majority of countries have advanced in protecting citizens’ physical integrity over the last several decades, especially in areas considered ‘developing’ regions of the world, such as Africa, Asia, and Latin America. 
 
 ### U.S. Births - Sites of Delivery by Time of Day
 Data source: Center for Disease Control and Provention - National Vital Statistics System, Birth Data Files, 2019. 
 
 ![fig_final_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72634325/147860984-d19db727-9ea9-4dfa-b97d-22c2e0e8d32d.jpg)

Overall, in 2019, the vast majority of births in the U.S. occurred in hospitals, with the highest density of hospital deliveries occurring between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., peaking during the hour following 8:00 a.m. After hospitals, homes and freestanding birth centers were the next two most common sites of delivery. Unlike the hourly distribution for hospitals, however, homes and freestanding birth centers experienced the highest volume of births in the early morning and late evening, representing an inverse trend across the hours of the day. Intended births at home peaked around the hours of 3:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., with deliveries at freestanding birth centers displaying a similar pattern. Interestingly, unintended births at home—though significantly less frequent than hospital, birth center, and intended home births) also saw a peak in frequency around 3:00 a.m. Whether hospital births peak during the workday due to modern medical practices (e.g. cesarian sections) can only be inferred from the data, but the visualization suggests that freestanding birth centers and homes may represent alternative delivery sites for mothers who enter labor at unexpected or odd hours of the day—or do not use medical techniques to induce birth during the hours of daylight.

### Chicago Public Servant Salaries
Data Source: City of Chicago public data portal, “Current Employee Names, Salaries, and Position Titles” as of July 28, 2021.

![PSET2_AH_FinalViz copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72634325/147861217-b6643366-3530-47a3-a791-2f549e7b695c.jpg)

Contrary to the expectation that specific departments might compensate employees of all types more highly, there appears to be a somewhat—though not strictly—inverse relationship between the salary of full-time employees (PTEs) and part-time employees (PTEs) across City of Chicago departments, with the departments with the most lucrative mean salaries for FTEs generally providing the lowest compensation to their part-time workers, and vice versa. As of July 2021, the three departments with the highest mean salaries for FTEs—police, family & support, and business affairs—were those with the lowest hourly rate for part-time personnel. On average, PTEs working for the City Council or public libraries, departments that provided the lowest annual salaries to FTEs, earned hourly wages materially higher than their part-time counterparts working for police, family & support, and business affairs functions. Meanwhile, PTEs working for the OEMC and aviation departments saw the second and third-highest average hourly wages relative to other departments, though FTEs in those departments received the fifth- and fourth-highest mean annual salaries. Examining the distribution of salaries and wages also illuminates unexpected insights. Certain FTEs in the aviation department were paid substantially more than those in any other department, and the City Council, which paid FTEs the lowest average annual salary, compensated a subset of part-time employees an hourly wage nearly $20 higher than the next highest department PTE maximum—representing significant variation. While most full-time departmental salaries followed nearly normal distributions, the part-time wages for employees in the animal control, OEMC, and business affairs departments were uniform, suggesting PTEs in those departments may be paid a standard wage.  Altogether, the data do not indicate that specific departments compensate their full- and part-time public servants more across the board.

### Deceptive vs. Truthful Visualizations for Drug Enforcement Administration Arrests and Drug Deaths
Data sources: United States Drug Enforcement Administration, “Staffing and Budget,” 1972-2021; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “Drug Overdose Deaths,” 1999-2019.

#### Deceptive visualization
![bad_f copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72634325/147861279-06610851-b712-42be-9f3e-d499f159b3e6.png)

For my deceptive visualization, I created a dual axis scale chart. I scaled the right y-axis ($) to begin at $1.4B instead of zero to maximally exaggerate the change in DEA expenditures over time. On the left y-axis of the graph, I plotted the “net efficacy” of the DEA over a time, which I calculated by subtracting total annual overdose deaths from annual DEA drug arrests. Net efficacy is a rather bogus metric in that it takes the difference between two different types of units (deaths vs. arrests), which is empirically nonsensical. However, a strong negative trend emerges when I plot net efficacy over time that manipulates categories to overemphasize a clear but misleading pattern. Additionally, the misleading aggregation obscures the nuances displayed in the non-deceptive graph when arrests and overdose deaths by type of drug are plotted in a separated format. While the graph includes a description of how net efficacy was calculated, I deemphasized it using lower-salience channels and put it in small, light grey font at the bottom corner of the visualization. I also selected intuitive colors that would emphasize the message I tried to convey about rising costs and falling efficacy by coloring the budget line in green (relation to money), and the efficacy line in red. Using an overlaid area graph, I highlighted the crossing of the net efficacy from positive to negative, and signified an adverse pattern by shading the area with red. Additionally, the data is obscured by smooth lines that create an aesthetic visualization but make it more difficult to gauge precise magnitudes and year-over-year changes. I heavy-handedly labeled certain years with historical events (conservative presidential elections and the financial crisis) in Photoshop to invite readers to draw false conclusions about causality, and included labels showing the relative change in budget over time (2019 budget/1999 budget), as well as the decrease in net efficacy over time (2019 net efficacy – 1999 net efficacy), but in using two different metrics also sought to obscure comparability and the truth. Finally, I created a “click-bait” title that uses strong verbs like “soaring,” “plunged,” and “plummets” to complement my chart-level deception with message-level deception and guide readers to drawing exaggerated conclusions. Taken together, my deceptive tactics seek to deceive the reader in somewhat subtle ways, drawing on visual cues and biased messaging that guide them to draw simplified conclusions without raising any glaringly obvious red flags (e.g. omitting years, nonlinear axes, etc). 

#### Truthful visualization
![good_f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72634325/147861266-6a58a789-a4c9-4171-b32a-82d39c975c7e.png)

Between 1999 and 2019, the DEA budget steadily rose, increasing by a total of $1.69 billion. Over the same period, drug arrests dropped in the early 2000’s before stabilizing around 30,000 per year with a slight decline after 2014. Drug-related deaths have simultaneously increased across every category, though benzodiazepine, prescription opioid, and heroin deaths have declined since the mid-2010s whereas methamphetamine and cocaine deaths have risen over the last few years at higher rates. Taken together, the DEA budget has increased alongside rising drug-related deaths and drug arrests have declined over the past two decades. Whether the data illuminates declining DEA efficacy or endogeneity between the pervasiveness of drug abuse and federal investment in mitigating drug crime remains to be explored by future research.
